# Post Scraper

**Post Scraper** is a tool that scrapes post listings and filters them based on specified keywords. It helps you find the best posts by removing promoted or irrelevant listings. The filtering mechanism works in two ways:

- **Inclusion:** Filters posts that include specified keywords based on the post's website.
- **Exclusion:** Removes posts containing unwanted keywords (using a keyword blacklist).

Currently, the tool scrapes posts from **LinkedIn**, with plans to extend support to other post listing sites in the future.
