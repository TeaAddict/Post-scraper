# Post scraper

Scrapes post listings and filters them based on specified keywords, including those you want the post to include and those you want to exclude. Essentially, it helps find the best posts by removing promoted or irrelevant listings. Currently it scrapes "linkedin" but I got plans for it to also scrape other post listing sites.
